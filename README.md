<p>My Name is Cole Perry and I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer. Prior to my transition into software engineering, I was an account executive in the computer software industry. During my sales career, I primarily focused on HCM, Payroll, and Financial ERP systems such as Workday and Paylocity. Wanting to build upon and improve these technologies is what led me to become a software developer.

When I'm not coding, I have too many hobbies to keep up with. I love snowboarding, lifting, and hanging out with my mini Ausiedoodle Blue!</p>
